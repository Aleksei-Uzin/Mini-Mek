# Project Mini-Mek

Practical Redux [link](https://www.educative.io/courses/practical-redux)

A sample application to accompany the \*_Practical Redux_ Educative course by Mark Erikson, demonstrating various useful Redux techniques.

This is a miniature version of the [MekHQ](http://megamek.info/mekhq) Battletech campaign force manager tool. The tentative list of planned features includes:

- Load JSON data describing the pilots and Battlemechs in a combat force
- For both pilots and Battlemechs:
  - Show a list of all items
  - Allow selection of an item in the list, and show details of the selected item
- Edit the details for a pilot
- Organize the pilots and their mechs into "lances" of four mechs, and the "lances" into a "company" of three lances.
- Add and remove pilots and mechs from the force
- Save the force back out to JSON
